# ManhwaClan-Scrapper

This was a quite fun project I did for fun to create my own Manhwa/Manga/Manhua Website, and this just only scraps from the [ManhwaClan](https://manhwaclan.com/) Website, that's all.

## API Endpoints

### Get Chapter Images

## Silent Update I did
- **API Improvement:** Added the `/api/image` endpoint to fetch images directly through the server, bypassing CORS issues.
- **Code Improvements:** Updated user-agent headers, and added delays between requests to mimic browser behavior and avoid being blocked.

## Note
- This is still a work in progress, so I need to improve more of it.
